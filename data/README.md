### This is a replication package on health insurance and educational attainment in Nigeria. Education level can help explain the disparities that exist in health insurance coverage. People with higher education may have better understanding of the health system when compare to those with lower education, therefore with a higher likelihood of health insurance subscription. 

### Even though it appears that women with higher education may have health insurance but may not be the case if age is controlled for because women with higher education are mostly going to be older. Type of place of residence is also controlled for because women in urban areas are likely to receive more education than their rural counterparts which may also have impact on whether they have health insurance or not because urban areas in Nigeria tends to have better healthcare system and infrastructure, thereby creating an interacting relationship.
